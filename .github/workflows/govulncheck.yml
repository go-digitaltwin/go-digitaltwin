# Go Vulnerability Scanning Workflow
#
# Uses govulncheck - the official Go vulnerability scanner - to detect known
# vulnerabilities in:
# - Application code
# - Third-party dependencies
# - Go standard library
#
# Key advantages over generic scanners:
# - Runtime analysis: Only reports vulnerabilities in code paths actually called
#   by the application (reduces false positives from unused dependencies)
# - Go's official vulnerability database (vuln.go.dev)
# - Go ecosystem expertise
#
# Results are uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning in SARIF format, providing:
# - Inline annotations on PR file diffs
# - Centralized vulnerability tracking in the Security tab
# - Historical vulnerability data
#
# IMPORTANT: This workflow does NOT fail on vulnerabilities. Enforcement must
# be configured via branch protection rules requiring the Code Scanning check
# to pass before merge.
