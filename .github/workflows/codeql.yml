# CodeQL Static Analysis Workflow
#
# Performs static analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities and
# coding errors using GitHub's CodeQL engine.
#
# CodeQL performs deep semantic analysis of the codebase, checking for:
# - Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
# - Code quality issues
# - Common programming errors
# - CWE violations
#
# Results are uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning for centralized tracking and
# inline PR annotations.
