# Continuous Integration Workflow
#
# Validates code quality and correctness on every pull request and push to
# main.
#
# The test job runs the test suite across multiple Go versions (stable and
# oldstable) with race detection enabled to catch concurrency issues.
#
# The lint job performs automated code quality checks using golangci-lint to
# catch common issues and style violations.
