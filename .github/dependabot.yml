# Dependabot Configuration
#
# Enables automated dependency management and security updates:
#
# 1. Dependabot Alerts: Notifies about known vulnerabilities in dependencies
#    - Visible in the Security tab under "Dependabot alerts"
#    - Email notifications for new vulnerabilities
#
# 2. Dependabot Security Updates: Auto-generates PRs to fix vulnerable dependencies
#    - Only creates PRs for security updates (not version updates)
#    - Respects semantic versioning constraints
#
# 3. GitHub Actions Updates: Keeps workflow actions up-to-date
#    - Prevents using deprecated or vulnerable action versions
#
# Note: Additional Dependabot settings (alerts, security updates) must be
# enabled in the repository's Security settings tab in the GitHub UI.
